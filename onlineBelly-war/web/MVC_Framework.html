<h1>&lt;JSF - JavaServer Faces&gt;</h1>
<h2>Short description</h2>
<p> JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a web framework implementing the MVC paradigm, 
        it is a Java-based web application framework intended to simplify development integration of web-based user interfaces.
	 The developer can easily integrate his business logic (model) in it and set the view as he desires,
	the controller is provided by JSF itself(JSF managed beans), so of no concern (literaly) to the developer.
	</p>
<h2>Technical features</h2>
<h3>MVC solution</h3>
<p> The view is rendered as a combination of JSP pages and JSF components. The developer uses expression language(dynamically manipulate data), tags(eg. the ajax tag to handle ajax calls) etc. to design it.
	The developer gets a high performance rendering and many customization options.</p
<p> The Model is realized with the backing beans. These provide the data and the operations and operations on them. These are linked
	through a/many managed beans(Controller in the MVC) which serves as a client to the EJB SessionBeans(Model in the MVC), which in return operate on entities that
	are managed with JPA.</p>
<p> The controller traditionally delegates the data and page flow. JSF provides these functionalities through Facelets. This is a lightweight 
	page declaration language that uses xhtml, tags, expression language and components to f.i. render the view.
	The controller is implemented as a managed bean so that the web service can make use of the session beans(Model in the MVC) managed by ejb.
	The framework handles the life cycle so that the developer doesn't have to worry about the boiler plate code, but more on
	his core functionalities</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p> JSF resolves a view name to the actual page and renders is. The name can be hard coded or can be provided as a return value 
	of a method in the managed bean(eg. return to a button's outcome or action atributes). This mechanism is called implicit navigation since the routing is less obvious than stating
	the full qualified link</p>
	
<h3>Form handling</h3>
<p> JSF has custom tags to achieve form handling. The form can contain child components as html markup.
	The data from the text and input fields is linked to the managed bean by his getters and setters.</p>
	

<h3>Validation</h3>
<p> JSF allows validation through build in and custom defined validators. It happens after the form value fields are 
	updated and results in a proceed (on success) or jump to the response handler (on failure). An example of built-in 
	validation are the use of annotations in the managed bean, like they exist in an entity class.</p>

<h3>Type conversion</h3>
<p> JSF provides standard converters that handle conversion between strings and java objects and vice versa(f:convertDateTime to convert between string and java.util.Date values). The	
	standard converter handles simple data types and are available through javax.faces.convert.Converter. Primitive types
	are automatically converted.</p>
	
<h3>Server-side handling of user interface events</h3>
<p> JSF has three types of event handlers: two Listeners for changes in inputtext & actions like clicking a component and also
	system level event handlers. The event handler for the listeners should be declared in the application code, this can	
	for instance be a method invocation</p>	
	
	
<h3>Rendering</h3>
<p> Rendering is the last step in returning a response to the client. The JSF components are put in a tree so that future
	rendering goes faster. To get the view, the components are translated to the html output. This again eases the web
	development by simplifying the overhead associated with the design of the web page.</p>
	
<h3>I18N and L10N</h3>
<p> All locale dependent storage can be kept in resource bundles outside of the source code so it has to be dynamically loaded and
	as such allows the possibility to adapt it to the users locale. Every supported locale is registered in the 'faces-config.xml'
	file and the resource bundles contain a '.properties' file for every locale. In this way, the correct data format and language can
	be presented to the user</p>
	
<h3>JavaScript integration</h3>
<p> Since JSF builds on standard web functionalities, it is of course possible to use JavaScript. The tag for a script
	element is 'outerScript', with properties name and library. As mentioned under 'render', this is translated to html
	where the fully qualified sourcepath is referred to</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<h3>Kind of documentation, quality, up-todate</h3>
<p> The documentation is available on the website of oracle. This documentation is very helpful, but the examples do 
	not cover all the situations that might occur. The documentation is not problem-solution organized, which is a
	downside, but that part is covered on fora. Also, for more ease of use, we made use of the primefaces library
	which has a very nice documentation (+500 pages) where they explain all the attributes of the tags and their
	usage. The standard tutorial websites also contain their trainings on JSF. These go from basic to really 
	elaborated</p>
	
<h3>Community activity</h3>
<p> Many 'questions' on JSF have been asked, so common issues can be easily resolved by just googling it. Next to stack overflow
	we also visited 'coderanch' a lot. It seems that one way or another, issues in usage of jsf and the functionalities can be
	resolved by doing a quick research</p>
	
<h2>Future evolution</h2>
<p> In recent years, JSF has had a lot of competition from JQuery and AngularJS. The alternatives simply provide a better
	scalability with their javascript framework and RESTful api backend. Yet, JSF is quite robust due to its maturity. 
	It is considered as legacy and can serve as a good introduction to front end of full stack developing</p>
	
<h2>Your perception</h2>
<p> JSF gives good vibes <i>because it works and gave us a good start</i>. It really enables you if you are unexperienced in the matter of designing
	a web application. It is advisable to work up to the more popular frameworks if you really want to exploit the skill of 
	java EE developer</p>
	
<h3>Ease of use</h3>
<p> As already said, the JSF framework might just be perfect for an introduction to java EE programming. While you might
	be experienced in coding business logic, you must still take a lot of steps to get the full stack developer status.
	As always, it is good to start with babysteps, so thats why the ease of use factor of JSF is a big plus</p>

<h3>Ease of installation</h3>
<p> It comes with the installation of Netbeans so a lot of support is available. Set up goes really fast.</p>
	
<h3>Learning curve</h3>
<p> After some getting to know time, we can really roll through the framework and include many functionalities. With other frameworks
	we might be able to achieve more, but the step towards them is much higher than to JSF</p>
